#### CMIP6 climate scenarios

The dataset was derived from simulations of eight models, with results aggregated using the ensemble median, alongside the 10th and 90th percentiles to capture variability. A bias-correction technique, specifically Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), was implemented within a spatial disaggregation framework. This approach aimed to mitigate uncertainties stemming from systematic model biases and enhance the spatial resolution of the projected data [@smau_bias-corrected_2024].

The changes were computed as absolute differences for air temperature (maximum, minimum and average), and as relative changes for precipitation.

The following scenarios were selected (as described below) [@riahi2017a]:

##### SSP1: Sustainability (Taking the Green Road)

The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects predicted environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity .

##### SSP2: Middle of the road

The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.

##### SSP3: Regional rivalry (A Rocky Road)

A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.

##### SSP5: Fossil-Fueled Development (Taking the Highway)

This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.

#### Hydrological scenario

The hydrological projections were derived using the **e_hypegrid** hydrological model, based on data from the **Copernicus Climate Data Store** dataset `sis-hydrology-variables-derived-projections` [@copernicus_hydrology_2021].

The variable used is **River discharge**.

**Simulations**

A total of 9 GCM-RCM combinations were used, involving 3 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and 3 Regional Climate Models (RCMs).

**Scenarios**

The following experiments were selected:

##### Historical (1971-2005)

Represents the baseline climate conditions, used to calibrate the models and provide a reference for future projections.

##### RCP 2.6 (2006-2100)

A stringent mitigation scenario (equivalent to **SSP1-2.6**). It aims to keep global warming likely below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Radiative forcing peaks at approximately 3 W/m² before 2100 and then declines to 2.6 W/m² by 2100.

##### RCP 4.5 (2006-2100)

An intermediate scenario (equivalent to **SSP2-4.5**). Emissions peak around 2040, then decline. Radiative forcing stabilizes at approximately 4.5 W/m² after 2100.

##### RCP 8.5 (2006-2100)

A high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (equivalent to **SSP5-8.5**). Emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. Radiative forcing reaches 8.5 W/m² by 2100.

**Period**: 1971-2100

#### Climate observational data

This section provides access to **monthly climatological reports (CLIMAT)** from land stations. These reports are sourced from the **Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) Open Data Server** and provide a valuable historical record of weather conditions.

**Data Source:** [DWD Climate Data Center (CDC)](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/monthly/qc/)

The following parameters are extracted and visualized:

::: {.table-responsive}

|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| **Mean Temperature** | °C | Monthly mean air temperature |
| **Absolute Max Temperature** | °C | Maximum temperature recorded in the month |
| **Absolute Min Temperature** | °C | Minimum temperature recorded in the month |
| **Mean Daily Max Temperature** | °C | Mean of daily maximum temperatures |
